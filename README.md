# Space-Invaders Style Game
This game is a python build of space-invaders.
The user controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, able to move left or right, and fire bullets.
A fleet of aliens move down the screen until they are all wiped out, or until the player dies.
When this happens a new fleet is created and the game continues until the player has used all
of their lives.

Managing this project end-to-end has taught me how to structure code for readability,
and how to break down problems into smaller, convenient steps.
It has also provided some use-cases for classes, beyond simply storing values.

I have to give credit to Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, for providing a well-written
resource to follow and build from.
### Technical aspects include:

- Readability. 
- User input. 
- Basics Classes, Functions, Loops. 
- Nested loops.

### Requirements: 

- Python 3.10.18 or later
- Install Pygame Package.
